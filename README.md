Below are the steps to set up and run both the frontend and backend of the project:

Frontend Setup:
Navigate to the frontend project folder.
Open the terminal and run the following commands:
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
Backend Setup:
Navigate to the project directory.
Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the backend server: python manage.py runserver
Important: Make sure to run the backend server first, and then proceed with the frontend part. Once the frontend server is running, you can access it via the link provided by the frontend.
